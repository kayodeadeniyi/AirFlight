<h1> Flight Booker App </h1>

This project is my implementation of the Flight Booker App for Andela's Simulation project (checkpoint 2) for Rail's track

<h2> Project Description </h2>

In this project, you'll get a chance to tackle some advanced forms. This is the kind of thing you'll have to work with when handling user orders for anything more complicated than an e-book. 

This project will require you to seed your database, so use your db/seeds.rb file to write the code necessary to populate Airports and Flights. One trick for apps like this (don't do it for production!) is to make your seeds file ::delete_all items from each table in your database and then completely repopulate them. That way, when you create a new model or change how you want your sample data set up, you can just update the seeds.rb file and rerun $ rake db:seed.
